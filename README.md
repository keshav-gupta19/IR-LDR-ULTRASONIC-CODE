# IR-LDR-ULTRASONIC-CODE
Infrared Sensor: If an object is detected by the infrared sensor then LED glows up. Basically when IR sensor state will be low then only the LED will glow up. I have attached the screenshot of the circuit diagram.
Light Dependent Resistor: It is basically used to detect the intensity pf light falling on it. If the intensity is smaller than 50 then the LED glows up. Otherwise the Led will remain OFF as shown in the circuit diagram.
Ultrasonic Sensor: It sends the UltraSonic Waves to detect the distance of the object from the sensor. It has two pins echo and trig pins which is used to transmit and recieve the signals. By applying Simple Mathematical Calculation we can easily calculate the distance of the object from the Sensor as shown in the given code.
OpenCV PROJECT AUTOMATION: In the attached .py file i have automated the id name by using a simple for loop. I have saved the images of aruco markers as the id1,id2,id3 and id4 as per their respective ids.
